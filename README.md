# README.md
My project is called CyHelp. It is an interactive chatbot that teaches users about cybersecurity and the CIA Triad. I made my project because I was interested in cybersecurity, and as I learned about it, I used my code to teach others about it in a fun way. I made my project through the Girls Who Code program using Replit. Sometimes, I struggled with bugs in my code, and would retrace my steps to see where i went wrong. This made my project take much longer than expected, but I am happy with the working result, and I learned to stay patient when debugging code.
